| **`stat file1`**              | Check **timestamps** (Access, Modify, Change) of `file1`.        |

🎯 Tip:
The touch command is not only for creating files but also updates timestamps if the file already exists.

📜 History Command — View Command History in Linux

🔸 Purpose:

When you type the command:

history

It displays a list of all the commands you have previously used in the terminal, along with their command numbers.

This helps you:

Recall what commands you’ve run.

Reuse commands without typing them again.

Track your command history during your Linux session.

🔥 Example Output:

1  mkdir dir1

2  cd dir1

3  touch file1

4  ls -l

5  history

6 To copy history to file :

 history > file1

 cat file1
 
→ This shows the list of commands you have executed in the order they were run.

🧠 Tip — Run Previous Commands Quickly:

Run any command from history by typing:

!<command_number>

Example:

!3
→ This will run command number 3 (touch file1).

✅ Bonus — Clear Your History:

To clear command history:

history -c

→ This will clear your terminal’s current session history.

🔥 Summary:

history → View previously used commands.

!number → Run a command from history.

history -c → Clear history.
