# 📜 Basics & History of Linux — Explained Simply

## 🕰️ How It All Started — The UNIX Story

In **1964**, a group of engineers at **Bell Laboratories, New Jersey**, started working on creating a powerful **Operating System (OS)** that could run **multiple tasks simultaneously**. This OS aimed to help users use computers more efficiently.

By **1969**, the team broke apart due to internal conflicts. However, **Dennis Ritchie** and **Ken Thompson**, two of the original members, continued the work. They developed an OS and named it **UNICS** (**Uniplexed Information and Computing Service**), which was later renamed **UNIX**.

In **1975**, **UNIX Version 6** was released. It became very popular because it was **free, open-source, and highly powerful**. Many big companies like **IBM**, **HP**, **Sun Microsystems**, and **Apple** adopted UNIX, modified it, and created their own commercial versions.

## 💡 Examples of UNIX Flavors (Versions)

| Company            | UNIX Version              |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IBM                | AIX                       |
| Sun Microsystems   | Solaris                   |
| Apple              | macOS (Based on UNIX)     |
| HP                 | HP-UX                     |

## 🐧 How Linux Was Born

In the early **1990s**, a university student named **Linus Torvalds** from **Finland** wanted to create an OS that was **free, open-source, and similar to UNIX**.

His professor, **Andrew Tanenbaum**, had created an educational OS called **MINIX**, which Linus used for learning.

Inspired by **UNIX** and **MINIX**, Linus started his own project. In **1991**, he released **Linux**, which is a **free and open-source operating system kernel**.

## 🧠 Important Note

👉 **Linux is technically not an Operating System itself — it is a Kernel.**

A complete Operating System consists of:
- **Kernel** → Core part that interacts with hardware.
- **Software Tools** → GNU commands and libraries.
- **User Interfaces** → CLI or GUI.

The combination of the **Linux Kernel + GNU Tools** forms what we commonly call the **"Linux Operating System."**

## 🚀 Why Companies Prefer Linux Over Windows

- ✅ **Free and Open Source** — No license fees.
- ✅ **Highly Secure** — Less prone to viruses and malware.
- ✅ **Faster and Lightweight** — No need for GUI on servers.
- ✅ **Multi-user & Multi-tasking** — Multiple users can work simultaneously.
- ✅ **Stable and Reliable** — Perfect for servers, cloud, development, and embedded systems.

## 🖥️ Windows vs Linux Architecture

### 🔵 Windows Architecture
Hardware → Operating System → Shell → GUI → User

- Users interact mainly through **GUI** (Graphical User Interface like icons, windows).
- GUI talks to the **Shell** (Command-line in the background).
- Shell communicates with the **OS**.
- OS interacts with the **Hardware**.

→ This extra GUI layer often makes **Windows slower** compared to Linux.

---

### 🟢 Linux Architecture (Server/CLI Mode)
Hardware → Operating System → Shell → User

- Users interact directly with the **Shell** (Terminal/Command Line).
- Shell communicates directly with the **Operating System**.
- OS interacts with the **Hardware**.

→ This makes **Linux faster, lightweight, and highly efficient**, especially for servers.

## 📂 File System Differences

| Windows Term     | Linux Term         |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Folder           | Directory          |
| Administrator    | Root               |
| Software         | Package            |
| C Drive (C:)     | Root Directory `/` |

### 🔸 In Windows:
- The default structure starts from **C:/** (Drive-based structure).

### 🔸 In Linux:
- The default structure starts from **/** (Root Directory).

## 🔥 Common Linux Directories

| Directory | Purpose                                         |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `/root`   | Home directory of the root (admin) user.        |
| `/home`   | Contains folders for all other users.           |
| `/usr`    | Installed software and applications.            |
| `/boot`   | Files required to boot (start) the system.      |
| `/etc`    | System-wide configuration files.                |
| `/bin`    | Basic commands available for all users.         |
| `/sbin`   | System commands (only root can execute).        |

## 🎯 Conclusion

- **UNIX** was the parent of many modern operating systems.
- **Linux**, created by **Linus Torvalds** in **1991**, is free, open-source, powerful, and widely used today.
- Linux powers most of the **internet, cloud servers, mobile phones (Android), and supercomputers**.
